### Object References
MyClass myObject;<br>
MyClass *myObject;<br>
In Objective-C we define the reference as "pointer" to the object. Pointer is denoted by the star (*) symbol <br>

## Object Creation
- Java <code>MyClass myObject = new myObject();</code>
- OC <code>MyClass *myObject = [MyClass alloc];
<br>
The brackets syntax is similar to calling "methods". In OC, calling a method also means sending a "message" to the class. In the above case, we are sending a "message" for the object to allocate memory and in turn the response from the class is an instance of the object. Apart from allocating the memory, we also need to initialize the object so we need to pass an init message
<code>[myObject init];</code>
The two steps above can be combined into one
<code>[[MyClass alloc] init];</code>
